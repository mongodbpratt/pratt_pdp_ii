This app is intended to be an MVP for a DOD asset managment platform.
The business case for this platform is to make the accounting and transferring of property between officers easier and quicker.
Personally, I hate Army Property Book Officers and I want to put that entire career series out of existence.
Primary revenue sources would be from selling data on asset statuses to large defense firms like Raytheon, Boeing, Lockheed, etc.
